# TEMPORARY TEST RULES - Use these to test if rules are the problem

## Copy these rules to Firebase Console to test:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // TEMPORARY: Allow all reads and writes for testing
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Steps:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
2. Replace with the rules above
3. Click "Publish"
4. Try posting a job
5. If it works, the issue is with the rules
6. If it still doesn't work, the issue is in the code

## After Testing:
Replace with proper rules from `firestore.rules` file

## What to Check in Logcat:
```
Filter: PostJobActivity
Look for:
- "Attempting to post job"
- "Job posted successfully with ID"
- "Job verified in Firestore"
- "Failed to post job"
```

If you see "Job posted successfully" but not "Job verified in Firestore", 
then the document is being created but immediately deleted or not persisting.
